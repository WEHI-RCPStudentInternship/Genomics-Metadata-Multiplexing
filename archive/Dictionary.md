### Fundamental Concepts

| Term | Definition |
|:------|:------------|
| Genomics | The study of genomes, focusing on the structure, function, evolution, and mapping of all genetic material within an organism. |
| Sequencing | Determining the precise order of nucleotides in a DNA or RNA sequence is crucial for understanding genetic variation. |
| Multiplexing | Sequencing multiple genetic material samples simultaneously, each labelled for efficient post-sequencing analysis. |
| Genomics Multiplexing | Applying multiplexing techniques to genomics to enhance the efficiency of sequencing multiple samples together. |
| Genomics Demultiplexing | Separating and identifying individual samples after a multiplexed sequencing run for independent analysis. |

### Molecular Biology

| Term | Definition |
|:------|:------------|
| DNA, RNA, mRNA | DNA is the genetic blueprint; RNA translates DNA messages; mRNA carries specific gene information from DNA for protein synthesis. |
| Unique Molecular Identifier (UMI) | Short sequences added to each DNA molecule before amplification to precisely quantify original molecules and correct sequencing errors. |
| Proteins | Complex molecules made of amino acids, essential for performing vital cellular functions. |
| Primer Index | A unique sequence of DNA added to a sample before sequencing, allowing for the identification and differentiation of samples in a multiplexed experiment. |

### Laboratory Techniques & Tools

| Term | Definition |
|:------|:------------|
| CEL-Seq2 | A method for single-cell RNA sequencing that precisely measures gene expression in individual cells. |
| FACS (Fluorescence-Activated Cell Sorting) | A specialised flow cytometry technique for sorting cells based on their fluorescence characteristics. |
| Well | A single compartment or space in a well-plate used to hold samples for experiments. |
| Well-plate | A plate with multiple "wells" used in labs to hold samples for various experiments, available in configurations like 96 or 384 wells. |
| Well barcode | A unique code for each well in a well plate, allowing for the tracking of specific samples or reactions. |
| Plate barcode | A unique identifier for an entire plate, facilitating the management of all contained samples. |
| Minibulk | A method where hundreds of cells, instead of just one, are loaded into a well to increase efficiency and reduce costs. |


### Data Analysis & Software
