## **FCS focus early in the process**

The FCS file merging process is performed by researchers day-to-day as an essential part of flow cytometry. We aim to replace the current manual operation with a simple automated process that can boost efficiency and accuracy.

## **Stages**
The FCS file process happens during the cell isolation step of the entire genomics multiplexing process.

This cell isolation is a delicate yet crucial process, which involves manual manipulation of data from FCS files to spreadsheets. Errors in this process can result in dubious downstream analysis results and sacrifice of efficiency. 
Hence, this project aims to automate this step with machine functions at the backend, which avoids prone-to-error human operations. 




## **Objectives**

**Efficient Processing**: Automate the conversion of raw FCS files into analysis-ready formats through advanced algorithms.

**Seamless Merging**: Provide an intuitive interface to merge FCS files with varying metadata, ensuring easy data integration.

**User-Friendly Platform**: Create an accessible Web Application for uploading, processing, and merging files.

**Metadata Management**: Enable researchers to edit metadata attributes to align with analysis needs.



## **Deliverable**

The core deliverable is the Web Application with features such as:

**File Processing**: Automatic processing of uploaded FCS files for quick merging.

**Merging Interface**: Intuitive tools for selecting files, specifying merging parameters, and initiating the process.

**Export and Sharing**: Options to export merged data in various formats and share with collaborators.



## **Benefits**

**Time Savings**: Researchers save significant time on data preparation and merging tasks.

**Collaboration**: Enhanced collaboration through easy data sharing and exchange.

**Accuracy**: Automated processes and validation ensure precise results.

**User-Friendly**: The application caters to researchers with varying technical skills.
