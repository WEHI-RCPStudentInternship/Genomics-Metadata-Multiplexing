Welcome to the ```past_implementations``` directory. Please do **NOT** delete any of the assets within this directory.

This markdown file contains the following assets:
1. [Directory Structure](#directory-structure)

## Directory Structure
- [```fcslog```](./fcslog/): is name of the 2023 Semester 2 intake's implementation of the [web application](https://github.com/WEHI-ResearchComputing/Genomics-Metadata-Multiplexing/wiki/Problem-Space#web-application) specified in the [Problem Space](https://github.com/WEHI-ResearchComputing/Genomics-Metadata-Multiplexing/wiki/Problem-Space) wiki page
- [```shiny_app```](./shiny_app/): is the 2023-2024 Summer intake's implementation of the web application specified in the Problem Space wiki page

NOTE: As **fcslog** and **Shiny-app** are 2 separate implementations of would-be web applications, they should be treated as individual repositories. That is, build assets, .gitignore files, test data and outputs, etc... should be stored within their own respective directories.
